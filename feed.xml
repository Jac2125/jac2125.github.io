Thus the Real Spectral Theorem states that $L_G$ has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of $L_G$. Therefore, for a graph $G$ of $n$ vertices, we can find $n$ eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct) for $L_G$. We denote them as $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$. Since they are all real and non-negative, we assume that \(0 &lt; \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_n.\)</p> <p>Now we prove some fundamental facts about Laplacians.
