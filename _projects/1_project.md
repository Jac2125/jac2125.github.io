Just got started with _STM32F103C6T6A_. I was about to purchase _STM32F103C8T6_ but I have received the previous one instead. Game is game, can't always complain. So I'll start using it with STM32 Cube IDE.

This page will show some demo code turning on PC13 LED along implementation of GPIO pin.

Here is the chip configuration

        {% include figure.liquid path = "assets/img/PC13 GPIO Pin Chip Config.png", title = "Chip Configuration", class "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
