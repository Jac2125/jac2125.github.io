This page is my study note of AN INTRODUCTION TO SPECTRAL GRAPH THEORY by Jiaqi Jiang

From Wikipedia, it introduces the spectral theory as the following:
In mathematics, spectral theory is an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of a single square matrix to a much broader theory of the structure of operators in a variety of mathematical spaces.

Then Spectral Graph Theory is a study of Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors of Graph. It deals with matrix representations of graphs, such as Laplacian and Adjacency Matrix. In this page, I wrote some cool properties of Laplacian Matrix and will write further study note about it.
Alright, before we hit the definition of Laplacian Matrix, here is the definition of $$L_{G_{\{u,v\}}}$$.

## Definition 1

Suppose $$G = (V, E)$$ is a graph with $$V = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$$. For an edge $$\{u, v\} \in E$$, we define an $$n \times n$$ matrix $$L_{G_{\{u,v\}}}$$ by

$$
l_{G_{(u,v)}}(i,j) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } i = j \text{ and } i \in \{u, v\}, \\ 
-1 & \text{if } i = u \text{ and } j = v, \text{ or vice versa}, \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise}. 
\end{cases}
$$

The matrix $$L_{G_{\{u,v\}}}$$ has a cool propertie:
$$
\vec{x}^T L_{G_{\{u,v\}}} \vec{x} = (x_u - x_v)^2
$$
for all $$\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$
## Definition 2

For a graph $$G = (V, E)$$, the Laplacian matrix $$L_G$$ is defined as:

$$
L_G = \sum_{\{u, v\} \in E} L_{G_{\{u, v\}}}
$$

### Theorem 3.3

The eigenvalues of a self-adjoint matrix are all real.

**Proof.** Suppose $$\lambda$$ is an eigenvalue of the self-adjoint matrix $$L$$ and $$v$$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $$\lambda$$. Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
\lambda \|v\|^2 &= \lambda \langle v, v \rangle \\
&= \langle \lambda v, v \rangle
\end{align*}
$$

## Definition 3.4

An $$n \times n$$ matrix $$M$$ is called positive-semidefinite if $$\underline{x}^{T} M \underline{x} \geq 0$$ for all $$\underline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$.

## Theorem 3.5

For a graph $$G$$, every eigenvalue of $$L_G$$ is non-negative.

**Proof.** Suppose $$\lambda$$ is an eigenvalue and $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $$\lambda$$. Then,

$$
\mathbf{x}^T L_G \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T (\lambda \mathbf{x}) = \lambda (\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x}).
$$

Since $$\mathbf{x}^T L_G \mathbf{x} > 0$$ and $$\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x} > 0$$, we have $$\lambda > 0$$. $$\square$$

As we have noted, the Laplacian matrix $$L_G$$ is self-adjoint and consists of real entries. Thus, the Real Spectral Theorem states that $$L_G$$ has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of $$L_G$$. Therefore, for a graph $$G$$ of $$n$$ vertices, we can find $$n$$ eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct) for $$L_G$$. We denote them as $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$$. Since they are all real and non-negative, we assume that

$$
0 < \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_n.
$$

Now we prove some fundamental facts about Laplacians. Recall that in the previous section we mentioned that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian tell us how connected a graph is. Now, we define connectedness. First, we give the definition of a *path*.

## Corollary 3.10

Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be a graph. Then the multiplicity of $$0$$ as an eigenvalue of $$L_G$$ equals the number of connected components of $$G$$.

**Proof.** Suppose $$G_1 = (V_1, E_1), G_2 = (V_2, E_2), \ldots, G_k = (V_k, E_k)$$ are the connected components of $$G$$. Let $$\mathbf{w}_i$$ be defined by

$$
(w_i)_{j} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } j \in V_i, \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Then, it follows from the previous lemma that if $$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a non-zero eigenvector of $$0$$, then $$x_i = x_j$$ for any $$i, j \in V$$ such that $$i, j$$ are in the same connected component. So,

$$
U_{i} = \text{Span}(\{\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_k\}).
$$

It is clear that $$\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_k$$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the multiplicity of $$0$$ as an eigenvalue of $$L_G$$ is the number of connected components in $$G$$. $$\square$$

# 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Laplacians of Some Fundamental Graphs

Now we begin to examine the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of some fundamental graphs.

## Definition 4.1

A complete graph on $$n$$ vertices, $$K_n$$, is a graph $$G = (V, E)$$ where $$V = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$ and $$E = \{(i, j) \mid i \neq j, i, j \in V\}$$.

## Proposition 4.2

The Laplacian of $$K_n$$ has eigenvalue $$0$$ with multiplicity $$1$$ and eigenvalue $$\nu$$ with multiplicity $$n - 1$$.

**Proof.** The first part of the proposition simply follows from Corollary 3.9. To prove the second part of the proposition, consider the Laplacian of $$K_n$$. It is an $$n \times n$$ matrix defined by

$$
a_{ij} = 
\begin{cases} 
-1 & \text{if } i \neq j, \\ 
n - 1 & \text{if } i = j.
\end{cases}
$$

Therefore, $$L_K - nI = M$$ where $$M$$ is the $$n \times n$$ matrix with entries all equal to $$-1$$. Clearly, $$M$$ is not invertible and has rank $$1$$. Thus $$n$$ is an eigenvalue of $$L_K$$. Then by Rank-nullity Theorem, $$\text{null}(M) = n - 1$$. It follows that the eigenvalue $$\nu$$ has multiplicity $$n - 1$$. $$\square$$

## Definition 4.3

The path graph on $$n$$ vertices, $$P_n$$, is a graph $$G = (V, E)$$ where $$V = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$ and $$E = \{(i, i + 1) \mid 1 \leq i < n\}$$.
